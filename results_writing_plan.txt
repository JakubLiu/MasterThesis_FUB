MAKE THE STUFF CHRONOLOGICALLY

- make the legend    --> DONE

- od ogółu do szczegółu

- state the general trends for sim1-3
	- powersL glob > mctp mod > mctp ------------------------> DONE
	- the tests are more powerfull for the AR2 that AR1 -------------------> DONE
		- here make a detour about the covariance matrices (lecture notes) and give the formulas in the 		  appendix
		- say that moreover for the AR2 the modified MCTP is almost as powerfull as the global
	- in Toe the test are more powerfull than AR1 but not as powerfull as AR2
	- add a plot of the same dim and the three cov structures ------------------> DONE
	- the power increases with dimensionality (say why this is intuitive)
	- add a plot with the same covstruct but different dimensionalities

- sim 4
	- the opposite powers
	- no effect of dimensionality
	- the powers for the covariance matrices is the same as in sim1-3 (AR2 > Toe > AR1)
	- add an example plot



NEXT STEP: make a detour about the covariance matirces in the appendix (only the formulas, the description of the phenomenon will be in the conclusions)
